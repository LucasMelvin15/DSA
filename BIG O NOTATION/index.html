    <h2>BIG O NOTATION</h2>
    <P>Also called time complexity</P>
    <p>Big O Notation gives us a precise ,numeric,objective way of judging the performance of our code </p>
    <p>It helps you write better code and becomes important as your inputs get bigger eg users/ posts for an app.</p>
      <h4>What does better implementatio mean?</h4>
      <p>Better means faster time to finish and use less memory(RAM)</p>
      <p>Performance is key and readability does not factor.</p>
